# Project
This is a repository to make me a Click Bus Back End Developer

## Dependencies
This project uses Gradle to manage code dependencies.
 - Spring Boot
 - Spring Data
 - Hibernate
 - Mysql
 - Java 8
 - Docker (to use containers)
 - Docker Compose (to use containers)

## Running the project
Once the dependencies is installed, it is possible to run the project.

First, build the project with the following command in the root directory:

`./gradlew build`

This will generate the jar artifact inside `build/libs` directory.

Run the following command to start two docker containers, one for mysql database and another for the application:

`docker-compose up` 

The app should now be running at port 8080 and you can perform some http request.

## Tests
